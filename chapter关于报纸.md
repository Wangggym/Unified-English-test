    I read newspapers every day. As a student, I have no time to watch news programs on TV. Besides, watching television takes up a lot of time. So reading the newspaper becomes the only way for me to learn about what's happening around the world.
    There is an old Chinese saying, "A scholar need not leave his home to know what’s going on in the world." Thus, reading the newspaper is a must for those who wish to keep up with the times.
