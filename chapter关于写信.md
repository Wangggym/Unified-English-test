First we can go to the Peoples' Square, the most famous place in Shanghai. Then we can go to Yu Garden, which I think you have heard before. In the evening, we may have dinner at my home and you care welcome to stay at my home for several days. I'm looking forward to your coming to Shanghai. I am sure you will like this city.

    Dear Cindy，
    Thank you for your invitation to your home for dinner yesterday. It was a beautiful night. I enjoyed the food and the music very much. This Saturday is my birthday, there will be a birthday party at my place, and I will invite some close friends to have dinner at my home. I do hope you can come to join us. We will have a barbecue in my back yard, and one of my friends will play the guitar, he can play very well. We can sing and dance to the music. It would be fun. Please make sure you will come. I am looking forward to having you at my party. 
    Yours， 
    Cathys
