                                        My Activities in Leisure Time
    I have many activities in leisure time, but I like watching TV most. In my spare time, I usually spend a lot of time in watching TV.
    My favorite TV program is news report. Watching this program is actually a kind of communication. From the program, I can learn a lot of things. I can learn the world from the program. I can broaden my mind through the program. No other things can bring me so much except news.
    That is why I like watching TV so much.
