Why do I study English? / (Why do students like learning English?) Firstly, English is very useful. English is the most widely used language in the world. If we make a visit to foreign countries or do business with foreigners, we need to communicate with them in English. Secondly, with China becoming stronger and stronger, we have more chances to go abroad. We can know the English-speaking countries much better if we know English. Both China and English-speaking countries have realized the importance of the culture exchange. Above all, English is useful and important, we must master English.

English is always my favorite subject and I am good at English. I would like to share four good studying habits with you. First, remember 20 new words a day, and never give up. Second, go over grammar points I have learnt in English class regularly. Third, read an English article in China Daily every day. Fourth, write an English composition every week and ask teacher to revise that for me to improve the writing level. If you do things above, I am sure your English will also be improved.

English is the course that I hate most of the long distance education and I am bad at English. English is really very hard for me, as it is so different from Chinese. First, I can’t remember a lot of new words. Second, I’m weak in grammar. Third, my listening is poor. Fourth, I can’t speak English very well, and I don’t have any chance to talk with foreigners. With so many difficulties, I am afraid of learning English and hate learning this course very much.

My Teacher / My Favorite Teacher
My favorite teacher is Li Ning. He is a strongly built thirty-year-old man. He is often simply dressed. He has been teaching us English since 2007. He devotes all his time and energy to teaching. He is capable of making his lessons lively and interesting, and all of us like his lessons. He is very strict with us but he shows us great concern. He offers us help whenever we need it. He is not only our good teacher but also our close friend. We all respect and love him.
